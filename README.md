# ati-broadcastapp
The ATI Broadcast app group is building a Facebook publishing app for the group America the Indivisible. Via this app an AITD trusted partner will be able to broadcast a message to multiply Facebook groups from one interface. This will allow the local groups in a region, of which there are many, to better communicate and mobilize toward specific actions.
