# Repository Technical Specs

These specifications describe technical aspects about this app. In particular, they discuss how the repository is organized, technical standards, etc.

## Technical overview

This app is built using a MERN stack: [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (via [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)), and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

We are running our apps on Google Cloud Platform, using Google App Engine. Builds and pull requests are tested and deployed via Travis.

## Some technical comments

+ This project is open to people from a variety of technical levels! So don't be afraid to try to contribute and, if you have questions, ask for help. (Also, React is not as complicated as it might seem at first!)

### Notes for non-experts

+ .jsx are just javascript files which also allow React components (things that look like -- but are not quite -- standard html). If you know javascript, you should be able to understand them!

+ Javascript is fairly straightforward syntactically. However, one of the trickiest parts is that it is run typically asynchronously, which can be confusing. Understanding that makes a big difference in being able to read and write javascript effectively.

+ To learn React, if you know javascript, I suggest you go to the Facebook documents. Start with (the tutorial)[https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html] and then do (the Quickstart)[https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html]. These give a good overview of the framework.

## Repository organization

### Sources

The repository organization is as follows:

```
├──server/                      the Express backend for serving static 
│  │                            files andservicing the API

```

### Production server

On the production server (or if `npm run compile`, `npm run compile-server` are run), the following additional files are generated by compiling the source:
```
├── dist/                 transpiled version of server/ from running babel
│   ├── ...
├── static/
│   ├── app.bundle.js     compiled client code from src
│   ├── vendor.bundle.js  compiled client code from node_modules
```

## Conventions

### REST API structure

+ For rest API endpoints, use spinal case, i.e. "this-style", not "thisStyle" or "this_style".

### Javascript

+ Use ES2015 syntax on both the server and client-side (including modules). Babel will be used to transpile code for wider compatibility with older browsers.

### React

+ React component class should be their own files

### JSON

We will (tentatively) follow the [Google JSON Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml).

### Linting

The code is linted via ESLint to follow the [Airbnb javascript guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). For contributors: running eslint (after you have run `npm install` in the main directory to install dependencies) is as easy as running `npm run lint` in the main directory.

## Development

To develop the code base, do the following:

1. [Install mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/). 
1. Follow [these Github instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to fork this repo to your account
1. In the repo directory, install the dependencies by running
    $ npm install
1. [Set up configuration variables](#configuration-variables)
1. Copy server/credentials-template.js to server/credentials.js and edit it. For example, try changing `'mongodb://'` to `'mongodb://localhost/atibroadcastapp'`.
1. Start the app via:

    $ npm run dev-all
    
The app should automatically detect changes to your code and recompile. The development server will listen on port 8000.

### Configuration variables

The following configuration variables are recognized:

variable name | (R)equired or default value | description
---- | ---- | ----
port | 8080 | port on which server will be run
fb\_appsecretid | R | Facebook App secret
fb\_broadcastuserid | R | Facebook broadcast user ID
mongo_connectionstring | R | connection string for mongo
cookiesecret | R | salt for cookies (currently unused)

Note that all variables are lowercase.

Because it is easiest to store configuration variables in different places in different environments, configuration variables are checked for in several places in the following order:
1. As argument (e.g. `node dist/server.js --port 40 --fb_appsecretid fjlj34`)
2. As an environmental variable
3. From the file server/credentials-secret.json
4. From Google App Engine project metadata (if being run on Google App Engine)

## Database collections

### Conventions

- State will be given as the 2-letter postal abbreviation

### Admin (settings)

The Admin collection hold settings for the Admin user. Each document must have a `name`, holding the setting's name, and then the other fields differ per setting and indicate the setting's values.

#### accessToken

token | String | The access token
expiryDate | Date | the token's expiration date

### Broadcasts

state | String | **[indexed]** state for which the broadcast is made
messageStates | [[MessageState](#messagestates)] | the history of the message's edits over its lifetime
groupStatus | {String: Mixed} | an object indicating each groups last confirmed state. Each key is the group id and each value is an array [MESSAGE\_ID, POST\_ID], where MESSAGE\_ID is from the messageState and POST_ID is `null` if the post has been deleted
broadcastOperations | [[BroadcastOperation](#broadcastoperations)] | in-depth history of the broadcast's updates, for debugging
editedState | Date | date that edit started if broadcast is being edited, null otherwise

#### MessageState's

## Backend API

All API URl's are prefixed with /api

(To be replaced by something using [documentation.js](http://documentation.js.org/), [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/), or [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org/)? Or [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)?)
