# Repository Technical Specs

These specifications describe technical aspects about this app. In particular, they discuss how the repository is organized, technical standards, etc.

## Technical overview

This app is built using a MERN stack: [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (via [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)), and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Some technical comments

+ This project is open to people from a variety of technical levels! So don't be afraid to try to contribute and, if you have questions, ask for help. (Also, React is not as complicated as it might seem at first!)

### Notes for non-experts

+ .jsx are just javascript files which also allow React components (things that look like -- but are not quite -- standard html). If you know javascript, you should be able to understand them!

+ Javascript is fairly straightforward syntactically. However, one of the trickiest parts is that it is run typically asynchronously, which can be confusing. Understanding that makes a big difference in being able to read and write javascript effectively.

+ To learn React, if you know javascript, I suggest you go to the Facebook documents. Start with (the tutorial)[https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html] and then do (the Quickstart)[https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html]. These give a good overview of the framework.

## Repository organization

### Sources

The repository organization is as follows:

```
├── server/                     the Express backend for serving static 
│   │                           files andservicing the API
│   ├── routes/                 API routes
│   │   ├── index.js            main routes
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── models/                 data models for API
│   │   ├── db.js               connect to the mongo DB
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── controllers/            backend API 
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── _common/                support files used in multiple sections
│   │   ├── ...
│   ├── server.js               starting point for backend
│   ├── credentials.js          holds secrets
├── src/                        client files for React
│   ├── App.jsx                 client starting point
│   ├── credentials-client.jsx  hold client credentials
│   ├── ...
├── static/                     static files
│   ├── index.html              shell for the client for React
│   ├── ...
├── scripts/                    scripts run separately from server process
│   ├── ...
```

### Production server

On the production server, the following additional files are generated by compiling the source:
```
├── dist/                 transpiled version of server/ from running babel
│   ├── ...
├── static/
│   ├── app.bundle.js     compiled client code from src
│   ├── vendor.bundle.js  compiled client code from node_modules
```

## Conventions

### REST API structure

+ For rest API endpoints, use "spinal case", i.e. "this-style", not "thisStyle" or "this_style".

### Javascript

+ Use ES2015 syntax on both the server and client-side (including modules). Babel will be used to transpile code for wider compatibility with older browsers.

### React

+ React component class should be their own files

### JSON

We will (tentatively) follow the [Google JSON Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml).

### Linting

The code is linted via ESLint to follow the [Airbnb javascript guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). For contributors: running eslint (after you have run `npm install` in the main directory to install dependencies) is as easy as running `npm run lint` in the main directory.

## Development

To develop the code base, do the following:

+ [Install mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/). 
+ Follow [these Github instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to fork this repo to your account
+ In the repo directory, install the dependencies by running
    $ npm install
+ Copy server/credentials-template.js to server/credentials.js and edit it. For example, try changing `'mongodb://'` to `'mongodb://localhost/atibroadcastapp'`.
+ Copy static/credentials-client-template.js to static/credentials-client.js and change googleClientId to a valid google client ID. (You can obtain a client ID by following the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project))
+ Start the app via:

    $ npm run dev-all
    
The app should automatically detect changes to your code and recompile. The app will listen on port 8000.

## Other notes

+ Project scaffolding based partly on the books [Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node
](https://www.manning.com/books/getting-mean-with-mongo-express-angular-and-node) and [Pro MERN Stack](http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484226520).
